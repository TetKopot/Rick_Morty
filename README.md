This App is implemented with JS, TS, React and has responsive design. At the start of the application, a request is made to the API and the list of characters from the cartoon is displayed. The list of characters is sorted by name.
Clicking on a specific character send a request for that individual character and redirect to another route with more detailed information about them.
The "go back" button redirect to the previous route with the list of characters.
Implemented a search among the characters by their name (when entering the name of a character, the list is filtered and display only matches with the search term, and the list of characters is also sorted by name).
Upon page refresh or route change, search data is preserved.
